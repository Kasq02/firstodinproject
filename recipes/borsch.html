    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our family's go-to recipe for Borscht (Red Beet Soup). It's best to have all of the ingredients prepped and ready to go which makes this soon super easy and care free. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or real mayo.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium beets, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken broth , + 2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 medium yukon potatoes, peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables (keeping sliced potatoes in cold water to prevent browning until ready to use then drain).</li>
        <li>Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. Add grated beets and saut√© 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened. </li>
        <li>Add 8 cups broth and 2 cups water. Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). Add 4 Tbsp Ketchup and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.</li>
        <li>When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
